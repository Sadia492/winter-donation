                Simply log in to our platform, browse the donation campaigns,
                and select the one you'd like to contribute to. Youâ€™ll find a
                donation form that you can fill out to submit your clothing
                donation. After submitting the form, our volunteers will arrange
                a pickup or drop-off location based on the campaign.

                Donations will go to vulnerable communities across Bangladesh,
                particularly those in rural and low-income areas who struggle
                with harsh winter conditions. Our platform connects donors to
                these communities through coordinated campaigns.

                Yes, gently used winter clothing is greatly appreciated! We ask
                that the clothes be clean, in good condition, and suitable for
                the cold weather. This way, we ensure the recipients receive
                clothing that will keep them warm and comfortable.

                Please check with your local tax authorities for information
                about potential tax deductions related to charitable donations.
                While we focus on providing warmth to those in need, we
                encourage you to inquire about any available benefits for your
                generous contributions.
