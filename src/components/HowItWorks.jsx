          focuses on a specific region of Bangladesh and lists the needs of
          vulnerable communities. Step 2: Choose a Campaign Select the campaign
          you’d like to support. You can read more details about each campaign,
          including the specific items needed, such as jackets, sweaters, and
          blankets. Step 3: Donate Clothing Gather your clean, gently-used
          winter clothing and accessories. You can donate items such as: Coats

          on the “Donate” button. You will be prompted to fill out a simple
          donation form that includes your contact details and the number of
          items you wish to donate. Step 5: Drop Off or Arrange Pickup After

          nearest collection point or volunteer pickup services in your area. If
          you’re unable to drop off your donation, we can arrange a pickup for
          you. Step 6: Confirmation Once your donation is received, you will
          receive a confirmation email or message thanking you for your
          generosity. You'll also be updated about the impact of your donation.
          2. Collection Points: Collection points are set up across various
          divisions, making it easy for you to donate. These are locations where
          you can drop off your donations. Some of the collection points may
          include local community centers, schools, or volunteer organizations.
          For your convenience, the website provides an interactive map of
          collection points in your division. You can find the nearest drop-off
